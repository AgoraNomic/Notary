  This contract only has up to two parties, one of the which is the
  Superzombie and the other is the Supermaster.

  A Player can become the Supermaster by announcement unless a Player
  already currently is the Supermaster.

  A Supermaster is either Active or Inactive, and they default to being
  Inactive.

  Cuddlebeam is a party to this contract, and is the Superzombie.

  An Active Supermaster can act on behalf of the Superzombie to perform
  any action on their behalf except for the following:
        - enter a contract, pledge, or other type of agreement;
        - initiate a Call for Judgement;
        - grant consent;
        - deregister.

  If a Supermaster has been Inactive for more than 7 days, that
  Supermaster ceases to be a party of this contract.

  A Supermaster becomes Active (and ceases to be Inactive) by Pledging 
  the following:
  "I Pledge that I will cause Cuddlebeam to Win Agora within 90 days.
  The "N" of this Pledge, for the purpose of its Class N Crime of 
  Oathbreaking is a googleplex.".

  A Supermaster that has been Active for more than 90 days ceases to be a
  party of this contract.

  While there is an Active Supermaster, Cuddlebeam cannot perform actions
  unless someone acts on their behalf to perform them.
