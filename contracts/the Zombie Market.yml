  This contract is named "the Zombie Market".

  Any entity CAN become a party to this contract by announcement. Any
  party to this contract CAN cease to be a party to this contract by
  announcement, unless e is the master of a zombie and does not own that
  zombie's Talisman.

  For each zombie whose master is a party to this contract, that zombie's
  Talisman is an asset, which, by default, is owned by that zombie's
  master.

  The owner of a zombie's Talisman CAN act on behalf of that zombie's
  master to act on behalf of that zombie. The master of a zombie SHALL NOT
  act on behalf of a zombie, or intentionally cease to be the master of
  that zombie, without the consent of the owner of that zombie's Talisman.
  The preceding notwithstanding, the master of a zombie MAY transfer the
  zombie to the owner of that zombie's Talisman.

  If the owner of a zombie's Talisman is a contract, then any entity CAN
  act on behalf of that zombie's master to act on behalf of that zombie
  according to the terms of that contract. That contract is considered to
  consent to an action if its text says so.
