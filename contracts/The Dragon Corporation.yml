  ## Bylaw 1: Definition

  This contract is named "the Dragon Corporation". The purpose of the
  Dragon Corporation is to earn as much money as possible for its
  shareholders.

  All other provisions of this contract notwithstanding, this contract
  does not permit any entity to act on behalf of any other entity.

  Shares of Dragon stock (also known as "shares of DRGN", or, in this
  contract, "shares") are a currency whose purpose is to represent
  ownership of the Dragon Corporation. An entity which owns at least one
  share is known as a shareholder.

  If, at any time, the Dragon Corporation or the Lost and Found Department
  owns any shares, then those shares are destroyed.

  Any person CAN, by announcement, become a party to this contract or
  cease to be a party to this contract. A shareholder who is a party to
  this contract is known as a member.

  Wherever this contract states that an entity becomes a party to this
  contract or ceases to be a party to this contract, all parties to this
  contract are considered to consent to this change.

  ## Bylaw 2: Proposals

  Any member CAN, by announcement, submit a Corporate Proposal. A
  Corporate Proposal must have exactly one of the types defined by this
  contract. Thereafter, any member CAN vote FOR or AGAINST that proposal
  by announcement, or retract such a vote, which causes the vote to become
  null and void. Whenever a member votes, all of eir previous votes on the
  same proposal are implicitly retracted.

  If a Corporate Proposal was submitted more than 7 but fewer than 21 days
  ago, and the proposal has approval (as defined in other bylaws), and the
  proposal has not been applied, then any member CAN, by announcement,
  apply the proposal, which has effects as defined in other bylaws.

  Members SHALL NOT submit, vote for, or apply proposals that are
  egregiously unfair to other shareholders (such as a proposal which takes
  or revokes shares from minority shareholders without just compensation).

  ## Bylaw 3: Amendment Proposals

  An Amendment Proposal is a type of Corporate Proposal. An Amendment
  Proposal has approval if at least one member has voted FOR it, and the
  number of shares owned by members who have voted FOR it is at least 2
  times the number of shares owned by members who have voted AGAINST it.

  When an Amendment Proposal is applied, the following occur:

  1. Each party to this contract who has not consented to the application
  of the proposal ceases to be a party to this contract. A party who has
  voted FOR a proposal consents to the application of that proposal,
  unless e has publicly stated otherwise at or after the time at which e
  voted FOR it.

  2. This contract is modified as described in the proposal.

  However, the application of an Amendment Proposal is INEFFECTIVE unless,
  in the same message, the entity who applies the proposal also publishes
  a text which is labeled as being the text of this contract after the
  application. E SHOULD, at that point, publish intent to ratify that text
  without objection.

  ## Bylaw 4: Ordinary Proposals

  An Ordinary Proposal is a type of Corporate Proposal. An Ordinary
  Proposal has approval if the number of shares owned by members voting
  FOR it is greater than the number of shares owned by members voting
  AGAINST it.

  When an Ordinary Proposal is applied, assets are created, destroyed,
  and/or transferred as described in the proposal; and entities may
  create, destroy, and/or transfer assets as permitted in the proposal.
  Such permission expires 30 days after the proposal is applied.

  After an Ordinary Proposal is applied, the person who applied it SHOULD
  publish a description of its effects in a timely fashion, including all
  balances of assets defined by this contract which were affected by the
  proposal.

  ## Bylaw 5: Bonds and Banknotes

  Perpetual Dragon bonds (hereinafter "bonds") are a currency. Banknotes
  are a currency.

  At the beginning of each Agoran quarter, each entity is awarded a number
  of banknotes equal to the number of bonds that e owns.

  If an entity owns a banknote, e CAN redeem the banknote by transferring
  1 coin from the Dragon Corporation to emself; the banknote is then
  destroyed.

  ## Bylaw 6: Recordkeeping

  If a party to this contract owns more shares than any other party to
  this contract, then that party becomes the President of the Dragon
  Corporation, if e is not already the President. The former President
  SHALL publicly inform the new President of this event in a timely
  fashion.

  The President is the recordkeepor of all assets defined by this
  contract, except those for which this contract specifies a different
  recordkeepor.
