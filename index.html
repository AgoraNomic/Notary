          <h3>The Dragon Corporation</h3>
          <div id='contract-parties'>Warrigal</div>
          <h2>Bylaw 1: Definition</h2>

<p>This contract is named &quot;the Dragon Corporation&quot;. The purpose of the
Dragon Corporation is to earn as much money as possible for its
shareholders.</p>

<p>All other provisions of this contract notwithstanding, this contract
does not permit any entity to act on behalf of any other entity.</p>

<p>Shares of Dragon stock (also known as &quot;shares of DRGN&quot;, or, in this
contract, &quot;shares&quot;) are a currency whose purpose is to represent
ownership of the Dragon Corporation. An entity which owns at least one
share is known as a shareholder.</p>

<p>If, at any time, the Dragon Corporation or the Lost and Found Department
owns any shares, then those shares are destroyed.</p>

<p>Any person CAN, by announcement, become a party to this contract or
cease to be a party to this contract. A shareholder who is a party to
this contract is known as a member.</p>

<p>Wherever this contract states that an entity becomes a party to this
contract or ceases to be a party to this contract, all parties to this
contract are considered to consent to this change.</p>

<h2>Bylaw 2: Proposals</h2>

<p>Any member CAN, by announcement, submit a Corporate Proposal. A
Corporate Proposal must have exactly one of the types defined by this
contract. Thereafter, any member CAN vote FOR or AGAINST that proposal
by announcement, or retract such a vote, which causes the vote to become
null and void. Whenever a member votes, all of eir previous votes on the
same proposal are implicitly retracted.</p>

<p>If a Corporate Proposal was submitted more than 7 but fewer than 21 days
ago, and the proposal has approval (as defined in other bylaws), and the
proposal has not been applied, then any member CAN, by announcement,
apply the proposal, which has effects as defined in other bylaws.</p>

<p>Members SHALL NOT submit, vote for, or apply proposals that are
egregiously unfair to other shareholders (such as a proposal which takes
or revokes shares from minority shareholders without just compensation).</p>

<h2>Bylaw 3: Amendment Proposals</h2>

<p>An Amendment Proposal is a type of Corporate Proposal. An Amendment
Proposal has approval if at least one member has voted FOR it, and the
number of shares owned by members who have voted FOR it is at least 2
times the number of shares owned by members who have voted AGAINST it.</p>

<p>When an Amendment Proposal is applied, the following occur:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Each party to this contract who has not consented to the application
of the proposal ceases to be a party to this contract. A party who has
voted FOR a proposal consents to the application of that proposal,
unless e has publicly stated otherwise at or after the time at which e
voted FOR it.</p></li>
<li><p>This contract is modified as described in the proposal.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>However, the application of an Amendment Proposal is INEFFECTIVE unless,
in the same message, the entity who applies the proposal also publishes
a text which is labeled as being the text of this contract after the
application. E SHOULD, at that point, publish intent to ratify that text
without objection.</p>

<h2>Bylaw 4: Ordinary Proposals</h2>

<p>An Ordinary Proposal is a type of Corporate Proposal. An Ordinary
Proposal has approval if the number of shares owned by members voting
FOR it is greater than the number of shares owned by members voting
AGAINST it.</p>

<p>When an Ordinary Proposal is applied, assets are created, destroyed,
and/or transferred as described in the proposal; and entities may
create, destroy, and/or transfer assets as permitted in the proposal.
Such permission expires 30 days after the proposal is applied.</p>

<p>After an Ordinary Proposal is applied, the person who applied it SHOULD
publish a description of its effects in a timely fashion, including all
balances of assets defined by this contract which were affected by the
proposal.</p>

<h2>Bylaw 5: Bonds and Banknotes</h2>

<p>Perpetual Dragon bonds (hereinafter &quot;bonds&quot;) are a currency. Banknotes
are a currency.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each Agoran quarter, each entity is awarded a number
of banknotes equal to the number of bonds that e owns.</p>

<p>If an entity owns a banknote, e CAN redeem the banknote by transferring
1 coin from the Dragon Corporation to emself; the banknote is then
destroyed.</p>

<h2>Bylaw 6: Recordkeeping</h2>

<p>If a party to this contract owns more shares than any other party to
this contract, then that party becomes the President of the Dragon
Corporation, if e is not already the President. The former President
SHALL publicly inform the new President of this event in a timely
fashion.</p>

<p>The President is the recordkeepor of all assets defined by this
contract, except those for which this contract specifies a different
recordkeepor.</p>

<h2>Bylaw 7: IPO</h2>

<p>Within 90 days after this contract is created, any entity CAN pay a
fee of 10 coins or 10 banknotes to the Dragon Corporation to buy a
share. When e does this, e is awarded 1 share.</p>

<p>Within 90 days after this contract is created, any entity who owns at
least 1 share may sell the share by announcement. When e does this, the
share is destroyed and e is awarded 5 banknotes.</p>

          <hr>
          
            <h4>Asset ownership (self-ratifying if I am the recordkeepor)</h4>
            <p>Share ownership:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gaelan: 4</li>
<li>Warrigal: 3</li>
</ul>

<p>No other assets defined by this contract exist.</p>

          

          
            <h4>Notes</h4>
            <p>Gaelan is the President. The IPO ends on May 30, 2020 at 23:13 UTC.</p>

          <p>This contract only has up to two parties, one of the which is the
Superzombie and the other is the Supermaster.</p>

<p>A Player can become the Supermaster by announcement unless a Player
already currently is the Supermaster.</p>

<p>A Supermaster is either Active or Inactive, and they default to being
Inactive.</p>

<p>Cuddlebeam is a party to this contract, and is the Superzombie.</p>

<p>An Active Supermaster can act on behalf of the Superzombie to perform
any action on their behalf except for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>enter a contract, pledge, or other type of agreement;</li>
<li>initiate a Call for Judgement;</li>
<li>grant consent;</li>
<li>deregister.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a Supermaster has been Inactive for more than 7 days, that
Supermaster ceases to be a party of this contract.</p>

<p>A Supermaster becomes Active (and ceases to be Inactive) by Pledging
the following:
&quot;I Pledge to cause Cuddlebeam to Win Agora. The &quot;N&quot; of this Pledge,
for the purpose of its Class N Crime of Oathbreaking, is a
googolplex, and its time window is 90 days.&quot;.</p>

<p>A Supermaster that has been Active for more than 90 days ceases to be a
party of this contract.</p>

<p>While there is an Active Supermaster, Cuddlebeam cannot perform actions
unless someone acts on their behalf to perform them.</p>

          <p>I pledge to not perform actions (while acting as myself, this doesn‚Äôt
affect me when twg is acting on my behalf) which have a clear intent to
be part of the usual gameplay of Agora nomic, without twg‚Äôs approval to
do them, as long as they are my Supermaster. This does not include
participating in commentary of the game, I can still communicate opinion
and such freely. This has a time window equal to the remaining time twg 
has as my Supermaster. The N for this Pledge‚Äôs Oathbreaking Crime is 10.</p>
