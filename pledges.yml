    I pledge, with N = 5, that for each player who gives me 2 coins as a
    bet within the next 3 days, I will deal that player a blackjack hand
    and resolve the bet according to the rules of blackjack.

    I will deal myself (as the dealer) only one hand, rather than one hand
    per player. If I ask you for your action and you fail to respond in a
    timely fashion, I will assume that you decline insurance or stand. If
    a card is to be dealt, I will deal it in a timely fashion, and if
    money is to be paid, I will pay it in a timely fashion. The time
    window of this pledge is 1 year.

    Infinite shoe; dealer hits soft 17; double after split permitted;
    double any two cards; re-split to 4 hands; re-splitting aces
    permitted; hitting split aces prohibited; no hole card; player loses
    only original bet against dealer blackjack; early surrender permitted;
    blackjack pays 3 to 2.

    I pledge that if, within the time window of this pledge, I receive a
    Lime Ribbon, I will transfer one half of my coins to the player or 
    players whose proposals made me eligible, divided evenly rounded down,
    and I will not attempt to defeat this pledge by fraudulent transfer of
    coins.

    I pledge to give (or grant, or otherwise enable ownership of) 600
    coins to each person who votes to endorse me in the ongoing Prime
    Minister election (and does not subsequently withdraw or change
    that vote). The time window of this pledge is 60 days and violating
    it is a Class 6 Crime.

    I pledge to not perform actions (while acting as myself, this doesnâ€™t
    affect me when twg is acting on my behalf) which have a clear intent to
    be part of the usual gameplay of Agora nomic, without twgâ€™s approval to
    do them, as long as they are my Supermaster. This does not include
    participating in commentary of the game, I can still communicate opinion
    and such freely. This has a time window equal to the remaining time twg 
    has as my Supermaster. The N for this Pledgeâ€™s Oathbreaking Crime is 10.
