    I pledge, with N = 5, that for each player who gives me 2 coins as a
    bet within the next 3 days, I will deal that player a blackjack hand
    and resolve the bet according to the rules of blackjack.

    I will deal myself (as the dealer) only one hand, rather than one hand
    per player. If I ask you for your action and you fail to respond in a
    timely fashion, I will assume that you decline insurance or stand. If
    a card is to be dealt, I will deal it in a timely fashion, and if
    money is to be paid, I will pay it in a timely fashion. The time
    window of this pledge is 1 year.

    Infinite shoe; dealer hits soft 17; double after split permitted;
    double any two cards; re-split to 4 hands; re-splitting aces
    permitted; hitting split aces prohibited; no hole card; player loses
    only original bet against dealer blackjack; early surrender permitted;
    blackjack pays 3 to 2.

    I pledge that if, within the time window of this pledge, I receive a
    Lime Ribbon, I will transfer one half of my coins to the player or 
    players whose proposals made me eligible, divided evenly rounded down,
    and I will not attempt to defeat this pledge by fraudulent transfer of
    coins.
